    <title>Play ScalaJS OrientDB multiproject bootstrap - Activator Template</title>

<div>
    <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This is a multiproject build that shows how to use
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play2</a>,
        <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/" target="_blank">ScalaJS</a>,
        <a href="http://orientdb.com/" target="_blank">OrientDB</a>,
        <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> and
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>
        in order to create a simple single-page application that displays data stored in a database.

        <a href="http://play-scalajs-orientdb-seed.alexray.me/" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find
        the working example of this seed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Server side of the application is based on Play2 Framework. Play is a high-velocity web framework for Java and
        Scala. It is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture, and follows MVC patterns and
        principles. Client side uses AngularJS framework and is written in ScalaJS and native Javascript.

    <h2>Interaction with OrientDB</h2>
    <p>
        OrientDB is a Multi-Model Open Source NoSQL DBMS that combines the power of graphs and the flexibility of
        documents into one scalable, high-performance operational database. Database interaction tools provided by the
        <a href="https://github.com/springnz/orientdb-migrations" target="_blank">orientdb-migrations library</a>
        enables interacting with the database in an asynchronous reactive way.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first step in <i>OnApplicationStart</i> point, located in <i>web</i> module, we create several
        test records in the database which represents a simple graph with a few nodes and edges between them.
        Data stucture of the graph is defined in <i>SharedJS</i> module
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Communication between back-end and front-end</h2>
    <p>
        To transit data from database to front-end application uses
        <a href="https://github.com/benhutchison/prickle" target="_blank">Prickle</a> library that allows easily
        pickling (serializing) object graphs between Scala and Scala.js.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the user, at client side, requests data from the database, the application starts an
        <i>OrientDbService</i> of the <i>ScalaJS</i> module to deserialize data provided and serialized by
        the server-side <i>DatabaseController.loadGraph()</i> method.
        <i>DatabaseController</i> uses
        <a href="https://github.com/springnz/orientdb-migrations" target="_blank">orientdb-migrations</a> library to
        load data from OrientDB.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Client side</h2>
    <p>
        Client side of application is based on AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap framework. It allows creating controllers
        both in ScalaJS and native Javascript. In order to visualise a graph represented in Scala classes, the
        application uses <a href="http://js.cytoscape.org/" target="_blank">Cytoscape.js</a> library
    </p>
